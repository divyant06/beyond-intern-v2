# Beyond Intern | The Premium EdTech Platform

Beyond Intern is an enterprise-grade, full-stack educational platform engineered to bridge the gap between academic learning and industry demands. Built with a focus on high performance, modern aesthetic (glassmorphism), and AI-driven user engagement, the platform delivers a seamless experience from course discovery to checkout and learning.

## 🚀 The Competitive Edge: Why This Architecture Excels

Unlike legacy LMS platforms (like WordPress/LearnDash or basic React apps), Beyond Intern is built on a modern, edge-ready architecture:
* **Blazing Fast Performance:** Utilizing Next.js 15 App Router and React Server Components (RSC) to ship zero-client-side JavaScript where possible, resulting in near-instant page loads and perfect Core Web Vitals.
* **Intelligent AI Integration:** Features a custom-built, streaming AI Advisor powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model, integrated directly into the UI without feeling like a generic "wrapper."
* **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Session management via NextAuth (OAuth & Magic Links), completely severing the frontend from raw database access.
* **High-Converting UI/UX:** Heavily optimized user flows, premium Tailwind CSS styling, translucent glassmorphism interfaces, and dynamic data pagination for frictionless browsing.

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Frontend & Core Framework:**
* **Next.js 15** (App Router, Server Actions, Turbopack)
* **React** (Hooks, Suspense, Concurrent Features)
* **Tailwind CSS** (Custom theme, complex gradients, Backdrop Blur utilities)
* **Framer Motion / Tailwind Animate** (Fluid transitions and component reveals)

**Backend & Infrastructure:**
* **Supabase (PostgreSQL):** Relational database with Row Level Security (RLS).
* **NextAuth.js:** Secure authentication (Google OAuth provider + Email).
* **Stripe API:** PCI-compliant checkout processing and secure webhook listeners.
* **Vercel:** Edge network deployment and CI/CD pipeline.
* **Google Generative AI SDK:** Streaming LLM integration (Gemini 2.0 Flash).

## ✨ Core Features & Components

* **AI Learning Advisor (`@chatbot.tsx`):** A floating, context-aware AI assistant that guides users toward the right career tracks, utilizing streaming server responses for zero-latency communication.
* **Dynamic Course Engine (`@course-grid.tsx`):** A responsive, paginated grid rendering high-fidelity course cards with dynamic pricing, categorization, and Unsplash API image handling.
* **Secure Checkout Flow (`@checkout/page.tsx`):** Server-side price validation preventing client-side manipulation, seamlessly handing off to Stripe Checkout.
* **Student Dashboard (`@dashboard/page.tsx`):** A personalized, authenticated hub tracking active courses, learning streaks, and gamified achievement badges.
* **Live Webinar System (`@webinar/page.tsx`):** Time-aware event scheduling with conditional logic for "Live", "Soon", and "Past" states, integrated with lead-capture forms.

## 🗄️ Database Schema (Overview)

The platform relies on a normalized PostgreSQL database designed for scale. Key tables include:
* `Users`: Manages authentications, roles (student/admin), and profile metadata.
* `Courses`: Stores curriculum data, pricing, duration, and categorization.
* `Enrollments`: Junction table tracking `user_id`, `course_id`, payment status, and progress metrics.
* `Webinar_Registrations`: Captures lead data for upcoming live events.
* `Transactions`: Audit trail for Stripe payment intents and webhook receipts.

## 🔮 Future Scope & Roadmap

As the platform scales, the architecture is primed for the following expansions:
1. **Proprietary Video Hosting:** Integrating an HLS video streaming provider (like Mux or AWS MediaLive) for DRM-protected course consumption directly within the dashboard.
2. **B2B Team Portals:** Building a separate tenant for enterprise clients to buy bulk seats and track employee learning metrics.
3. **Advanced AI Tutoring:** Expanding the Gemini integration to read specific course transcripts and provide context-aware homework help to enrolled students.
4. **React Native Mobile App:** Leveraging the existing Next.js API routes to power a native iOS/Android application.
